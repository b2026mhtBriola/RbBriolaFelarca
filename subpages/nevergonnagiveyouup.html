    <p style="float: left">Rick Astley's 1987 hit is widely considered as one of the greatest songs of the '80s. The memorable tune and 
    flashy music video cemented it as a classic song that is hard to forget. It spread rapidly across the Internet 
    as a prank; somebody would click on a link and be transported to the song's YouTube video
    instead of whatever they intended to visit. Thus began Rick Astley's greatest legacy: the Rickroll.</p>
  
    <p style="float: right">The Rickroll is widely considered as the greatest meme of all time, and for good reason. First appreaing in
    2004, it is a mutated form of the Duckroll, wherein a user clicks a link and is diverted from their intended 
    destination to a photo of a duck on wheels. The first recorded instance of the Rickroll substitited the 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">trailer of Grand Theft Auto 4</a> for the song.</p>

    <p style="float: left">Since this first instance, the Rickroll has not only cememnted itself as an Internet classic, but it has 
    also caused a resurgence in the popularity of Rick himself, winning the EMA 2008 Best Act of All Time, and 
    other awards. </p>
