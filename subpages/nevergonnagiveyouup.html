    <h1>Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley</h1>
    <p>Rick Astley's 1987 hit is widely considered as one of the greatest songs of the '80s. The memorable tune and 
    flashy music video cemented it as a classic song that is hard to forget. It spread rapidly across the Internet 
    as a prank; somebody would click on a link and be transported to the song's YouTube video
    instead of whatever they intended to visit. Thus began Rick Astley's greatest legacy: the Rickroll.</p>
  
    <p>The Rickroll is widely considered as the greatest meme of all time, and for good reason. First appreaing in
    2004, it is a mutated form of the Duckroll, wherein a user clicks a link and is diverted from their intended 
    destination to a photo of a duck on wheels. The first recorded instance of the Rickroll substitited the 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0" target="_blank">trailer of Grand Theft Auto 4</a> for the song. Since this first instance, the Rickroll has not only cememnted itself as an Internet classic, 
    but it has also caused a resurgence in the popularity of Rick himself, winning the EMA 2008 Best Act of All Time, and 
    other awards. Additionally, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0" target="_blank">Official Music Video</a> is one of an elite club of songs to surpass the 1 Billion View mark.</p>

    <p>The use of the song in memes revolves around the 'roll. Aside from the usual <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA3tnx5GFVA" target="_blank">8- and 16-bit remixes</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxjY_YTksKM" target="_blank">the medival covers</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpiB2wMc49g" target="_blank">the anime covers</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCWDDox1nE" target="_blank">the bass boosts (lower your volume)</a>, a lot of the meme's humor comes from the endless ways one can play/sing the song, and therefore Rickroll you. See the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO7bRMa9bmA" target="_blank">Big Ben's final chime</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDs7KkGcQ6M" target="_blank">the Padre's Petco Park Performance</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gpOaudRRqI" target="_blank">the stupid amount of soundfonts you can play the song in.</a> Since most people will recognize the original video's URL, some videos are dedicated reuploads that provide alternate links for Rickrolling. A few are listed below for convenient access:</p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_8Nh5XfRw0" target="_blank">4K 60FPS Remastered Edition</a>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0" target="_blank">Different Link + No Ads (7 sec)</a>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIcxXJHNqPc" target="_blank">Alternative Link Lol (9 sec)</a>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKwCzJgAEKw" target="_blank">Alternate Link but Country Roads</a>
    </p>

    <p>Also, have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfC6ey0MYGY" target="_blank">Trombone Champ edition</a> I don't know where else to put this.</p>

    <p>Though the song is almost 40 years old, the meme surrounding it is still thriving, still mutating, still surviving. It is one of the unspoken Rules of the Internet: If it exists, it can be turned into a Rickroll. At this point, almost 20 years after the birth of the meme, we still find new ways to preserve Rick Astley's legacy. You could say that we never gave him up.</p>
