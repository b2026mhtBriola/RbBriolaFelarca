  <h2>Never Gonna Give You Up</h2>
  <p>Rick Astley's 1987 hit is widely considered as one of the greatest songs of the '80s. The memorable tune and flashy music video cemented it as a classic
  song that is hard to forget. It spread rapidly across the Internet as a prank; somebody would click on a link and be transported to the song's YouTube video
  instead of whatever they intended to visit. Thus began Rick Astley's greatest legacy: the Rickroll.</p>
  
<p>The Rickroll is widely considered as the greatest meme of all time, and for good reason. First appreaing in 20xx, it is a mutated form of the Duckroll, wherein a user clicks a link and is diverted from their intended destination to a photo of a duck on wheels. The first recorded instance of the Rickroll substitited the trailer of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">GTA 4</a> for the song.</p>
