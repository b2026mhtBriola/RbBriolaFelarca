    <h1>Fortunate Son by Creedence Clearwater Revival</h1>
  
    <p>There are a lot of things that come to mind when mentioning the Vietnam War: the thick jungle, UH-1 Huey helicopters, the orange plumes of napalm, and of course, the incessant use of Fortunate Son.</p>
    <p>In 1969, CCR's lead John Fogerty wrote a song expressing his anger at Vietnam and the Nixon administration: Fortunate Son. It would become the anthem of the US involvement in Vietnam. It complains that the children of the rich and powerful, the "fortunate ones", don't suffer the consequences like the commoners. The song's message resonated with the American public, becoming the anthem of the anti-war movement.</p>
    <p>It's so synonymous with the anti-war movement that it ended up being the de facto anthem of the Vietnam War. From its incessant use in Vietnam-related shows and movies like Forrest Gump (1994) to its appearance in games like CoD: Black Ops (2010), the use of Fortunate son is an easy way to induce flashbacks to its era.</p>
    <p>In memes, the song serves as both a theme song for the Vietnam War and in general, anything involving <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nak5FNcc0SY">a helicopter (or similar vehicles)</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1kNZdUMgxw">a tropcal environment</a>, or just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvs7LZit3lQ">the ending to something.</a></p>
    <p>War is hell, but at least Vietnam had a good soundtrack.</p>
