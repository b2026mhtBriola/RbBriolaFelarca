/*Updated Content*/
    <p>Smash Mouth's 1999 hit All Star is a shining beacon of the Early '00s Internet Meme. Released on May 4, 1999 as a follow-up to their other hit <a href="" target="_blank">Walking on the Sun</a>, the song garnered favorable critical and public reception. The tounge-in-cheek humor of the song, in addition to its upbeat melody, cemented its fate as an early meme song.</p>
    <p>The first major meme stemmed from its appearance in the <a href="" target="_blank"></a>opening credits of the 2000 movie Shrek. The resulting popularity of the movie simultaneously boosted the band's, making Smash Mouth the "Shrek People", as seen in their later songs such as <a href="" target="_blank"></a> and <a href="" target="_blank"></a>. But the memes kept coming and they didn't stop coming, dozens of parodies would hit the ground running. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey5GItze-BY" target="_blank">a Bach chorale</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-jq81OsL1o" target="_blank">a Medival cover</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEcTdl9AspE" target="_blank">proof that it works with any song</a>.</p>
    <p>Then there's <a href="" target="_blank">Jon Sudano</a>. His 2016 cover of the song would cause a revival of the song and by extension, its memes.</p>
    <p>All that glitters is gold, and All Star definitely broke the mold.</p>
