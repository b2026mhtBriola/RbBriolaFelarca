## Memes Never Die: Immortalized Songs of the Internet

The project seeks to explore famous songs that heve been cemented in the public memory
through "memes", short humorous clips or images that spread rapidly across areas of the Internet.
For this this project we have curated the 4 (in our opinion) most iconic song that fit this description.
These 4 songs are but a small sample of the immeasurable numbers of memes that prevail in our digital world.


List of Pages:
  1. Homepage - A Primary Directory of the website, and a summary of the basic premise of the site.
  2. Never Gonna Give You Up - The Icon of the Internet Meme
  3. All Star - Smash Mouth's Shrek Smash Hit
  3. Take On Me - a-ha's Electronics-heavy Hitter
  4. Megalovania - One of the Most Famous Video Game Tracks of All Time, sans rival.
