  <h2>Never Gonna Give You Up</h2>
  <p>Rick Astley's 1987 hit is widely considered as one of the greatest songs of the '80s. The memorable tune and flashy music video cemented it as a classic
  song that is hard to forget. It spread rapidly across the Internet as a prank; somebody would click on a link and be transported to the song's YouTube video
  instead of whatever they intended to visit. Thus began Rick Astley's greatest legacy: the Rickroll.</p>
